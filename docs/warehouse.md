# Warehouse

A directory with a `warehouse.yml` configuration file is considered a Soda 
warehouse directory and it implies a directory structure of one directory 
per table.

A warehouse represents a connection to any SQL engine like: Snowflake, Redshift, 
BigQuery, Athena, Postgres, etc 

## Example

Here's an example Soda warehouse directory structure:

```
+ sales_snowflake
|   + warehouse.yml
|   + customers
|   |   + scan.yml        
|   + invoices
|   |   + scan.yml
|   |   + invoices_without_active_country.yml        
|   |   + invoices_with_inactive_products.yml        
```

`warehouse.yml` contains the name of the warehouse and 
the connection details (see below)

`customers` and `invoices` are table directories, each 
having a [scan.yml](scan.md) configuration file.

`invoices_*.yml` are user defined [SQL metrics](sql_metrics.md)
that also get executed when a table scan is performed

## warehouse.yml

warehouse.yml contains the name of the warehouse and the connection details.

We encourage to refer to environment variables for credentials 
in the configurations files because those files are typically into  
version control. 

For example:
```yaml
name: my_project_postgres
connection:
  type: postgres
  host: localhost
  username: env_var(POSTGRES_USERNAME)
  password: env_var(POSTGRES_PASSWORD)
  database: sodasql
  schema: public
```

Each warehouse will require different configuration parameters.
See [Warehouse types](warehouse_types.md) to learn how to configure each 
type of warehouse. 

The example above shows you can refer to environment variables for 
credentials.  See section on [Env vars in CLI](cli.md#env-vars) to learn more.

Soon, Soda project files will also include an optional 
link to a Soda cloud account.  A cloud account enable you to push the monitoring 
results after each scan and share them with other people in your data organisation.
