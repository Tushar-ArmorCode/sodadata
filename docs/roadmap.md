# Current status and roadmap

**Current status**

Soda SQL is currently in beta. While the codebase is quite young, it does build upon our
experience of many field implementations and customer inputs.

We have seen many home grown solutions for this problem.  With this project, we want to
combine our expertise with these efforts and jointly build something that any individual party
could not achieve.

**Roadmap**

Now
* Support Postgres (Done)

End of January 2021
* Support Snowflake
* Support AWS Redshift
* Support GCP BigQuery
* Support AWS Athena

Later
* Support Spark SQL
* Support Dremio
