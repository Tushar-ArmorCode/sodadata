Explaining Soda and how to get started is a long list of task-based documentation items.
This doc content shows how those task-based documentation items can be presented in a
hierarchical manner.

Start from the goal: What is Soda? What are the components and how to set those up.

Each time start with the overview that explains the choice options or list of tasks 
to complete.

Gradually break down the high level hierarchically to the smallest of tasks that is 
documented.  The docs here show that hierarchical approach to task based documentation.

When there are choices to be made, in the overview section list the choices and provide 
guidance on how users should choose.

Consistently document with prerequisites for tasks.

Consistently deal with completion validation.  Meaning at the end of a task, how can a 
user get confirmation that the task is completed successfully. (and optionally intermediate 
validation if it's a long list of tasks)
