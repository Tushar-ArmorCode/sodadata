# Setting up a Soda Agent

The Soda Agent comes in 2 flavors: Soda-managed or Self-managed.
We recommend [the Soda-managed agent](#setting-up-a-soda-managed-agent).  It is the easiest and fastest 
way to get a Soda Agent up and running.  The Soda-managed agent will run inside the Soda SaaS service.

Alternatively you can choose for [a self-hosted Soda Agent](#setting-up-a-self-hosted-agent) in case 
you prefer to run the Agent in your own environment.  There are detailed instructions, but knowledge 
about network configuration, Kubernetes and Helm charts is highly recommended.
