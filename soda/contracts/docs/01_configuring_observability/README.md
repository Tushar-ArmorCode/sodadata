If you are just getting started with data quality, chances are you 
are experiencing data quality issues and questions around data that 
need to be investigated by a data engineer.

Soda's observability platform is easy to set up and will help you 
diagnose any data issue by creating visibility into your data stack
automatically.

Using Soda's data observability, an engineer can start diagnosing any 
data issue.  A data issue can be an consumer that has noticed some weird data 
and asks to verify.  Another example is a alert notification of the data 
monitoring parts of Soda.  

Soda's observability platform enables engineers to start digging and perform 
the technical investigation to find root causes or answer any questions about 
the quality of data.

Of the three components needed for a data quality strategy, observability is the 
easiest to set up.  While observability is great to enable data issue debugging, 
it is not strategy to prevent data issues from occurring.

## Setting up observability

This section explains how to set up Soda Cloud to start collecting 
observability metrics and how to start using Soda Cloud as the 
platform to diagnose potential data issues.

Potential data issues may come from 
* Users reporting something wrong or weird with the data
* Observability noticing something weird with the data
* Soda Cloud consumer checks
* Contract checks

> Prerequisite Soda Cloud: To set up Soda observability a Soda Cloud account is required.
> See [Seting up a Soda Cloud account](../04_setting_up_a_soda_cloud_account/README)

To set up a Soda observability, perform the following 3 steps:
1. [Set up an agent](#1-setting-up-an-agent)
2. [Connect the agent to a warehouse](#2-connecting-the-agent-to-a-warehouse)
3. [Configure an observability schedule]()

### 1) Setting up an agent

See [Setting up a Soda Agent](../05_setting_up_soda_agent/)

### 2) Connecting the agent to a warehouse

### 3) Configure an observability schedule
