# Enabling contract requests

When data producers manage contracts as code in git, there are typically many more people outside
the producer team that can contribute to the knowledge of what good data looks like.

This is done by the notion of start-right, shift-left.  Start right means enabling consumers
to request checks or even build and operate their own checks in the Soda Cloud environment.
