# Schema examples

The `name` property of each column is **required**, it has to match with the name in the SQL engine.

Property `data_type` is optional.  Only when specified, it is verified.

```yaml
dataset: CUSTOMERS
columns:
    - name: id
      data_type: VARCHAR
    - name: size
```

The name has to match with the actual column name in the SQL engine.
