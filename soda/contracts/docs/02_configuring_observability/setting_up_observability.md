# Setting up observability

This section explains how to set up Soda Cloud to start collecting 
observability metrics and how to start using Soda Cloud as the 
platform to diagnose potential data issues.

Potential data issues may come from 
* Users reporting something wrong or weird with the data
* Observability noticing something weird with the data
* Soda Cloud consumer checks
* Contract checks

The Soda Cloud observability platform is the central place where 
engineers can diagnose data issues coming from any of the above 
mentioned sources.
